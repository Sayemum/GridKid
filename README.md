GRIDKID

# Description
GridKid is a spreadsheet application that runs on the terminal. Like other spreadsheet programs, GridKid presents a table of cells that the user fills with data and formulae to achieve various computational tasks. The user will enter into cells either code or plain text data like the string `total:` and the number `1.68`. The code may contain cell references, variable references, multiple statements, conditionals, loops, and function calls.

This interface displays the grid and uses an interpreter to lex, parse, and execute code entered into a cell.

The snippet above shows the default spreadsheet when you run `ruby main.rb` in the terminal. You can freely navigate around the grid using your arrow keys and each cell shows two pieces of information: the formula for that cell and what's being displayed.

The program has two modes: `view` and `edit`. View mode lets you navigate the grid, while edit mode lets you modify the formula in a currently selected cell. The snippet above demonstrates editing a cell with a formula and then the display panel gets updated to show the calculation.

The snippet above shows a more populated grid with the current cell demonstrating variable references, cell references, and loops.
