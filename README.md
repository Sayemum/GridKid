GRIDKID

Description:
GridKid is a spreadsheet application that runs on the terminal. Like other spreadsheet programs, GridKid presents a table of cells that the user fills with data and formulae to achieve various computational tasks. The user will enter into cells either code or plain text data like the string `total:` and the number `1.68`. The code may contain cell references, variable references, multiple statements, conditionals, loops, and function calls.

This interface displays the grid and uses an interpreter to lex, parse, and execute code entered into a cell.
